This file is the manual for Team 12's program for checking graph isomorphism.

In this folder you'll find following files:
- main.exe         -- executable file that contains the program
- how-to.txt       -- this manual
- graphs           -- a folder which contains:
    - basicAut1.gr     --
    - basicAut2.gr       |
    - basicGI1.grl       |
    - basicGI2.grl       |- files containing graphs or sets of graphs for testing the program.
    - basicGI3.grl       |
    - basicGIAut.grl   --

After running the main.exe file simply follow the instructions. If you want to check how the program
works with some other input graph or set of graphs, please replace the contents of one of the .gr[l] files.
